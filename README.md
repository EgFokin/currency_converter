<h1 align="center">Important note</h1>


If you want to use this script, you need to connect to any external API that provides real-time currency exchange rates.

The API used in this example is 'Fixer.io'. You can replace it with any other API that provides real-time currency exchange rates by changing the values of the variables URL and ACCESS_KEY.




<h1 align="center">Tips</h1>

Instead of using the INPUT method for the variables 'amount', 'from_currency', and 'to_currency', you can manually set the conversion values based on the data in your project.
